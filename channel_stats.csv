If you're looking for a complete SQL tutorial for beginners with examples, this tutorial is a great way to learn SQL basics. Just follow through and you'll be able to write SQL queries in no time. 

SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is a language used by software developers, data scientists and anyone who works with data. With SQL, you can store data in relational databases and write queries to extract valuable information. 

There are various database management systems (DBMS) that support SQL but each product has its own implementation of SQL. In this course, we'll be using MySQL to learn SQL. MySQL is the most popular free and open-source database management system in the world. If you use a different DBMS (eg SQL Server), you can still benefit from this course as 90% of the skills you'll learn in this course can be transferred to other database management systems.",5751840,139539,0,6905,mosh

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in 2022. A lot of people are learning JavaScript to become front-end and/or back-end developers. 

I've designed this JavaScript tutorial for beginners to learn JavaScript from scratch. We'll start off by answering the frequently asked questions by beginners about JavaScript and shortly after we'll set up our development environment and start coding. 

Whether you're a beginner and want to learn to code, or you know any programming language and just want to learn JavaScript for web development, this tutorial helps you learn JavaScript fast. 

You don't need any prior experience with JavaScript or any other programming languages. Just watch this JavaScript tutorial to the end and you'll be writing JavaScript code in no time. 

If you want to become a front-end developer, you have to learn JavaScript. It is the programming language that every front-end developer must know. 

You can also use JavaScript on the back-end using Node. Node is a run-time environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. With Node and Express (a popular JavaScript framework), you can build back-end of web and mobile applications. 

If you're looking for a crash course that helps you get started with JavaScript quickly, this course is for you.

How to Create a Network of Machines in VirtualBox with SSH Access,2017-07-20T16:00:03Z,"In this video, we'll be learning how to clone Virtual Machines, add these machines to a network so they can communicate with each other, make sure they have internet access, and also set up SSH so that we are able to SSH into these machines from our host machine. This will allow us to pretty much build an entire virtual lab that we can use to test all kinds of different software. So after we're done, this will give us the ability to quickly spin up a new VM that behaves just like a real machine on our network. Let's get started.

Python OOP Tutorial 3: classmethods and staticmethods,2016-07-11T16:00:05Z,"In this Python Object-Oriented Tutorial, we will be learning about classmethods and staticmethods. Class methods are methods that automatically take the class as the first argument. Class methods can also be used as alternative constructors. Static methods do not take the instance or the class as the first argument. They behave just like normal functions, yet they should have some logical connection to our class. We will look at some examples of both of these in order to understand both in depth. Let's get started.

Decorators are a way to dynamically alter the functionality of your functions. So for example, if you wanted to log information when a function is run, you could use a decorator to add this functionality without modifying the source code of your original function. So let's take a look at how these decorators work and a few ways in which we can use them. Let's get started.

Setting up a Python Development Environment in Eclipse,2015-10-25T16:30:00Z,"In this video, we will be setting up a Python development environment in Eclipse using the PyDev plugin. If you've watched my videos before, you have likely noticed I use the Sublime Text text editor for the tutorials. I use this for the videos because it is very clean and easy to use without all the bells and whistles of a full blown IDE. But there are times when an IDE is extremely useful. For example, if you need to debug your application, an IDE is likely what you would like to use.

There are several other options out there for Python IDEs. But Eclipse is free open source software. It can also be used to program in several other languages. Let's go ahead and get started on setting up our Python dev environment in Eclipse.

"Sublime Text Quick Tip: ""Go To Definition"" Click Shortcut",2015-03-31T02:44:00Z,"In this Sublime Text Quick Tip, we're going to see how we connect a mouse shortcut to the ""Go To Definition"" command.

If you have ever programmed in Eclipse, you have probably used this shortcut a lot. If you're like me, I find myself missing this functionality in Sublime Text. Luckily it isn't difficult to get this setup.

CSS Tips and Tricks: Add External URLs to Print Stylesheets,2014-12-29T17:07:11Z,"Printing out URLs can be a nice edition to print stylesheets. When someone prints your article or blog post, you want them to know where your links would have taken them so that they can investigate those sources further if they desire.

However, you don't want to include every link in the print stylesheet. Your internal links that loop back to your own website aren't necessary and will bog down the print stylesheet with a lot of unneeded text.

So how do we add only the external links to the print stylesheet? In this video, we will cover several techniques you can use in order to achieve this.

WordPress Tips: Test your theme with Theme Unit Test and Monster Widget,2014-11-26T02:26:50Z,"When I first started developing WordPress sites, I found myself constantly adding dummy data so I could get an idea for how specific elements would look with my theme. Manually adding dummy data was not only slow, but it was also easy to leave out a lot of different test cases.

In this video, I'm going to show you a great way to add sample data to your WordPress site with Theme Unit Test and the Monster Widget plugin.

The Theme Unit Test data and Monster Widget plugin are two great ways to see how your theme visually handles a variety of content.

WordPress Plugins: Imsanity,2014-11-23T22:47:37Z,"In this video, I'm going to show you my favorite WordPress Plugin for keeping large image sizes under control.

It seems like every modern camera and cellphone can take amazing pictures. But those large images can take up a lot of unneeded space on your server. Not to mention it will slow your pages to a crawl if you try to load multiple images that are thousands of pixels wide.

Imsanity fixes this problem by allowing us to set a maximum image size. Then every time an image is uploaded, the file is resized for us, saving us both time and space. We just set it and forget it. Simple as that.
